## What is the MLSVS?
The MLSVS (Machine Learning Security Verification Standard) provides a basis for testing the security of machine learning systems and models, and provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.

The primary aim of the MLSVS is to standardize the range of coverage and level of rigor in the market when it comes to verifying the security of machine learning systems and models. The standard provides a basis for testing the security controls of these systems and models, as well as any security controls in the environment that are relied on to protect against potential vulnerabilities. This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of machine learning systems and models.
